# SQL Demonstration
In this project, I demonstrate the use ERD tool to design a database and to show the relationship between the various tables, which can be an 1-to-1, 1-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.  With the ERD tool, it automatically creates scripts to create and alter the database and its relatiobnship to each other.
